# How to run the code
Open LFN_Project.ipynb in Colab and execute. 

It takes 10 minutes to install the "graph-tools" library.
The Jupiter notebook LFN_Project.ipynb imports by itself all the .py files.
The code also imports .pkl files that contains all the the graphs that have been converted from the FMRI. 
Precisely there are 20 graphs for each disease (ADHD, Schizophrenia, Bipolar, Controlled).
You can also compute the graphs from fmri by yourself in the section "MRI to Graph" of Jupiter notebook LFN_Project.ipynb
